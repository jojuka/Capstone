## Motivation
This project explores individuals classified under the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services nonimmigrant student visa statuses.
Having grown up in Melanesia and attending international school for all my formative years, I understand the nuances of migration. 

Within the American context, discussion over immigration seems to center around individuals who have an illegal status. However, there are many reasons and approved government classes for one to immigrate to America, whether on a temporary basis, as in a holiday, or for more permanent reasons.

## Data Question

* Age and sex at visa admission
* Students and Exchange Visitor to nonimmigrant visa ratio  
* Country of citizenship for approved Students and Exchange Visitors applicants
* U.S. state of study for Students and Exchange Visitors

## Challenges
* Narrowing the scope of discussion based on the timeframe for completion and availability of data
* Initially, research was focused solely on F1 students or those pursuing academic studies in a U.S. higher educational institution. However, across multiple parameters, data was grouped according to students – that is both F1, M1 or vocational students and J1 or exchange visitors/study abroad students, and their dependents. Thus, I could not isolate for F1 students alone.
